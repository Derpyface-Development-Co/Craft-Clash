PLANNING DOCUMENT
=================
M. I'm using abbreviations for our names. M. for you, W. for me.

M. can you put the textures and any other logos that you have created in the following folders:
- assets/logo for logos
- assets/textures for textures
- Anything else let me know.

I will have the front screen GUI look mostly like the Minecraft Pocket Edition GUI.
Still working out some details and kinks, should be able to do most of my work on Saturdays!
The first version number will be 0.0.1 BETA. All the version information can be found in the CHANGELOG.txt file.
