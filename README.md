A dynamic cross of Clash of Clans and Minecraft. Create a world and play in it, defending your walls and fighting the monsters that come at night.
Written in Python for you!

##Installation
###Through the Python Module
* Download the Python module if you havenâ€™t already: [Download Link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2.exe), and install it,
* Extract the files in your GitHub download,
* Double click the main.py file in File Explorer,
* and the app will open for you to use!

## Gameplay Instructions
Double click on the main.py file and the program will launch to the welcome screen. From there you can select three buttons. Currently the only button that works is the Exit button which exits the program. The other buttons all exit the program too.

Eventually the Play! button will launch you into the world and the Options button will open the options screen.
