# Craft-Clash
**WE ARE STILL IN BETA! SOME FEATURES DO NOT WORK YET!!**

A dynamic cross of Clash of Clans and Minecraft. Create a world and play in it, defending your walls and fighting the monsters that come at night.
Written in Python for you!

##Installation
###Through the Python Module
*Download the Python module if you havenâ€™t already: [Download Link](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.2/python-3.5.2.exe), and install it,
*Extract the files in your GitHub download,
*Double click the main.py file in File Explorer,
*and the app will open for you to use!

## Gameplay Instructions
First in order to play you will need to go to the craftclash folder an open up the playscreen.py file. 

Then you will need to change the path inside `worldoneimg = PhotoImage(file = "D:/William/Documents/Necti Co/CraftClash/BETA_V1.0/assets/logo/titlethumbnail.gif")` on line 19 to the absolute path for your computer to the assets/logo/titlethumbnail.gif file on your computer.
If you have any other problems let me know.

Right now the only buttons that work are the Play! button and the Exit button. The Play! button will open the Play Screen so you can select a world (which will lead to the program closing).
The Exit button will exit the program, as will the options button because we haven't confiqured it yet.
